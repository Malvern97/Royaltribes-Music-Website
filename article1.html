 				love of art and value adding through entertainment.This happened after identifying the value in ability exhibition when my directory of music had key tracks necessary to be officially recorded, published and shared.
				I would describe my music as native, comprising of a blend of modernity and our rich heritage ethnics able to transform and reserve our beautiful sound.
 				relatable, entertaining  and life giving in the music spectrum.
				 However the music prospects began out of the diverse skills and abilities which includes art in general, writing, composing and singing.

				 to explore the capabilities thereby creating a network of my social handles, music publishing , a music production team, as wel as my website.<br>
